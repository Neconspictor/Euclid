Important:

- Refine description to the repository

- Implement PBR

- Implement  Deferred Rendering 

- Implement  SSAO

- Add fast UI in addition to NanoGUI

- Create Demo scene

- Add build instruction

- Link to 3d party dependencies
 

- ARB_SHADING_LANGUAGE_INCLUDE extension is only supported by NVIDIA GPUs. 
We need a modul for parsing #include directives!

- vld and Brofiler are incompatible and cannot be run both on the same time.
  ->Maybe find alternative solutions
- Support for left handiness
- Support for [0,1] range for the z ccordinate in clip space 
- Alpha Blending disturbes texture targets with less than 4 components (so no alpha channel is addressable)
  -> create a 'smart' solution


Unimportant:
- util::relativePathToBuildDirectory is very slow, make it faster

Nice to have:
- Check, if window width and height is in range of the current screen resolution for windowed mode
- Check if fullscreen resolution is supported and adapt it if necessary
